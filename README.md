## Pulseritas Co App 💖

Pulseritas Co is a small nonprofit initiative based in Lima, Peru, co-founded by Linda Munarriz and Daira Yovera. We sell handmade bracelets and use the proceeds to fund nutritious breakfasts for elderly street workers.

When Excel became chaotic (and refused to multiply values 💀), this app was born: a clean and simple tool that helps us track sales, reinvestment, and impact.

## Features:

-Register bracelet sales (with auto-calculated reinvestment and breakfast impact)

-Visualize sales by day and bracelet type

-Store and update sales data easily

-Track total breakfasts funded

-Delete last entry in case of errors

-Login system for individual team members

## Why this app?
We wanted a tool that would keep us:

-Organized with daily operations

-Transparent with every sol spent

-Motivated by seeing our impact in real time

This is my first ever web app and I loved building it for a cause I care deeply about.

##About Pulseritas Co:
Our mission is simple: turn bracelets into breakfast.

Each “Pulserita Corazón” and “Pulserita Power” funds a portion or full breakfast. Every sale helps feed someone in need.

Daira handcrafts each bracelet. Linda manages the logistics, finance, and tech.
